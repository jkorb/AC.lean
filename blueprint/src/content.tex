This is a proof of concept project that aims to verify the results of:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Fine, Kit. 2016. "Angellic Content." In: \emph{Journal of Philosophical
		      Logic} 45: 199--226.
\end{itemize}

in Lean4.

The goal is to show that for the purposes of research in philosophical logic,
Lean4 is:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Easy to learn and use.
	\item Powerful enough to formalize and verify the results of a recent paper in
	      philosophical logic.
	\item

\end{itemize}

\section{Roadmap}

The following are the main results of the paper that we aim to formalize:

\begin{definition}
	\lean{Fml}
	\leanok
	A \emph{propositional formula} is one constructed from sentence-letters $p_1,
		p_2, \mathellipsis$ by means of the connectives $\neg,\land$ and $\lor$.
